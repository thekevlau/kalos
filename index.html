<p>Kalos understands information from multiple sensors to help you make sure you are exercising correctly and effectively. For our 1.0 release, Kalos is currently optimized for the weighted barbell squat, <a href="http://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2009/07/08/why-you-need-squats-in-your-workout-and-how-to-do-them-right/">one of the most popular and effectively exercises of all time</a>. </p>

<p>Kalos will observe all aspects of your weight lifting form- how many times you lifted a given weight, how fast you moved that weight, your positioning of the weight and even your weight and pressure distribution throughout the lift, to give you a comprehensive understanding about how you exercise. After understanding this information, Kalos will be able to make recommendations for you to correct your form and further optimize your workout.</p>

<a id="technology-and-architecture" class="anchor" href="#technology-and-architecture" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Technology and Architecture</h2>

<p>At the core of Kalos is the state-of-the-art <a href="http://www.techopedia.com/definition/28247/internet-of-things-iot">IOT</a> mobile application engine, <a href="http://evothings.com/">EVOThings</a>. With it, Kalos is able to use information from a variety of sensors to track all of an athlete's movement information with respect to the weight being used. </p>

<h3>
<a id="kalos-sensor" class="anchor" href="#kalos-sensor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Kalos Sensor</h3>

<p>Kalos uses the CC2650STK inertial measurement unit developed by Texas Instruments to capture all inertial information about an athlete's movement in three dimensions. The sensor can be used with any kind of weight as it is designed to easily adhere to any kind of weight that can be found at the gym. You won't even notice it's there.</p>

<h3>
<a id="kalos-platform" class="anchor" href="#kalos-platform" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Kalos Platform</h3>

<p>Kalos also utilizes a proprietary sensor pad machined in-house that can be integrated into any kind of weight lifting platform to understand your weight and pressure distribution throughout the lift.</p>

<p>Please note that Kalos is currently still in Closed Beta. Look out for our kickstarter campaign in the months to come as we prepare for large scale manufacturing and distribution of our hardware technologies. We currently have plans to release the mobile application for iOS and Android.</p>

<p>In the future, Kalos will continue to develop it's platform to incorporate a wider variety of biometric sensors and data analytics tools to further optimize its capabilities. Stay tuned for more updates!</p>

<p>Please note that Kalos is pending patent pending.</p>
