	<h1>How To Publish iOS Apps</h1>

	<p>To publish an app on the Apple App Store is a process that will take some work if you are new to it. Set aside at least a couple of days to go through the submission procedure.</p>
	<p>It is recommended to start out by reviewing <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html">Apple's distribution guide</a>.</p>
	<p>The web is full of information and help for how to submit apps to the App Store. One example is <a href="http://forum.ionicframework.com/t/how-to-submit-ios-app-to-app-store-using-xcode/1795">this thread</a> at the Ionic forum.</p>
	<p>To help you prepare your Evothings app for publication, we will add more information to this page. Stay tuned!</p>
	<p>You are also welcome to ask for help at the <a href="http://forum.evothings.com/">Evothings Forum</a>.</p>
